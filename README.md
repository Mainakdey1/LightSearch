# LightSearch
An open-source distributed scalable search engine built for speed. Stores structured and unstructured data, powers observability and real time analytics.

This platform, inspired by elasticsearch, has been built for speed and accuracy. It will power your API's database search needs, be it vector or otherwise, and will scale to whatever scale is required. All architecture and docs are shared so that it can be accessed
by the public and suggestions for improvements are always welcome.
